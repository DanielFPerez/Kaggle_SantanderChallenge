    "# Santander Customer Satisfaction\n",
    "Before starting, a short recap about the problem goal. Given is an anonymized dataset of santader customers containing a large number of numeric features and one binary value describing if the customer is satisfied or not (1 for unsatisfied customers, 0 for satisfied customers). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal** is to build a model to predict a customer satisfaction based on given features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prodvided Data\n",
    "    - *train.csv*: labeled data containing features and target values. Each data sample (customer) is a row in the csv\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problem Description\n",
    "    - **Type**: binary classification problem\n",
    "    - **Evaluation metric Santander**: Area under the ROC curve (aka AUC) \n",
